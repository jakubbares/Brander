  "prompt1":"I have assured Robert Metsola that the Czech Republic is ready to play a much more active role in European affairs. We have something to offer, we can name the problems and we can propose solutions. I support the advancement of the Czechs to key positions in the EU so that we can maintain this constructive approach.",
  "prompt2":"These include China and the future of Ukraine. We face difficult decisions, but decisions that are crucial for the stability of life in the EU and the Czech Republic. Together we are stronger.",
  "prompt3":"It is also about explaining that our security is not just a matter for the military. Resilience and preparedness is a matter for the whole country, the whole society. It is therefore our shared responsibility to meet our commitments.",
  "prompt4":"Our children also experienced the invaluable benefits of education here. The proximity of classmates from all over the world gave them a perspective and understanding that changed their view of the world.",
  "prompt5":"We are experiencing perhaps the greatest security crisis in modern history. We can only successfully navigate it if we stick together. The way forward is for us to work together, to avoid unnecessary competition, to work to increase our resilience and our ability to confront threats.",
  "prompt6":"I have spent several years on NATO soil, but today I arrive for the first time as a head of state. I want to assure our partners that the Czech Republic has the ambition to be not only a reliable but also a confident ally. We will use all our assets to move security issues forward.\nA strong NATO is a guarantee of our security. In 2024 we are ready to fulfil our commitment to invest at least 2% of GDP in defence. We are ready to invest even more if necessary, if the planned expenditure is linked to concrete projects.",
  "prompt7":"Watch today's interview with Deník.cz live at 10:30 a.m. on https://bit.ly/3MS7K6u. Hundreds of thousands of people from the regions are accessing these regular interviews, and that's what matters to me. I am not indifferent to their concerns and needs and it is important for me to be close to them. The interview will also be published tomorrow in the printed daily in all regions across the Czech Republic.",
  "prompt8":"Prague Castle has become an almost inaccessible place in recent years. Not only because of the security frames at the entrances, but also because of the overall impression. The castle seemed like a closed domain of officials where people are not welcome. I promised to do my best to reopen Prague Castle to the citizens. And also to bring back cultural, social and educational events here.\nI am glad that today was perhaps the last time people waited in line at the entrance. Today we have started to remove the security frames and only random checks will replace the mandatory ones. This change is being made on the basis of an analysis of the security situation prepared by the police, which I have seen. We are still working on removing the security barriers against unwanted vehicle entry",
  "prompt9":"Yesterday, I had the honour of presenting the Hall of Fame award at the Angel Award ceremony to a man whom I respect greatly and whose work has accompanied me throughout my life. He has made me laugh and taught me many times. He is none other than Zdeněk Svěrák. Zdeněk, thank you for your lifelong contribution to Czech culture.",
  "prompt10":"The meeting with Romani students at Prague Castle confirmed to me once again that where there is a will, there is a way. They have succeeded in breaking down prejudices and have begun to study often very difficult fields of study. I hope that they will also be a role model for their peers, who will be inspired to pursue their education.",
  "prompt11":"Prejudice often comes from a lack of information and little willingness to listen. The students that Eva and I met today have managed to break out of the cycle of prejudice and are setting a good example for their community and for mainstream society. Such examples need to be shown",
  "prompt12":"The National Security Council is one example of the necessary coordination of state leaders on security and foreign policy issues. \nI will participate in it whenever necessary and my time permits. It is one of the ways to make the most informed decisions in office.",
  "prompt13":"Eva and I would like to continue to display them on special occasions. We have also met their authors in person. See how we enjoyed our time together. \nAnd what the children were most interested in at the Castle and what animal they would like to have there, you will find out today at 18:40 in News on ČT Déčko.",
  "prompt14":"A prominent voice of dissent, a defender of human rights even after 1989 and a person who was always there for others. \nShe was one of those who recognized evil and never betrayed what she fought for by her strong personal example. Honor her memory.",
  "prompt15":"We would like to wish you to spend Easter in an environment where you will recharge your energy and with people you love. \nFor Eva and me, the holiday is all about the comfort and joy of the beginning of spring. I hope our Micka sees it the same way.",
  "prompt16":"And since we have collected a lot of them, we decided to meet their authors in person.\nWe welcomed a group of children at the Castle, with whom we visited the exhibition of children's pictures and talked together. \nWe hope that we will be able to repeat this nice meeting full of children's curiosity. Thank you for it!",
  "prompt17":"It's a threat to democracy and the only way to get out of this threat is through the slow and very patient process of telling people the truth, building arguments on measurable facts and slowly winning back the trust people have lost.",
  "prompt18":"By joining NATO, Finland has gained a guarantee of collective defence. NATO is stronger for a country with a modern, well-equipped army, a country confident and determined to defend its values and ours. President Putin wanted to weaken the West and has achieved the opposite. Together we are stronger and safer",
  "prompt19":"I have never pretended to be an expert on everything. A good president doesn't have to understand everything, but he must be able to make good and informed decisions. That is why I have assembled a team of respected experts to help me accomplish my goals in various key areas.",
  "prompt20":"One year after the liberation of the Ukrainian city of Bucha, the Bucha Summit was held in Kiev to honor the victims of the massacre committed by Russian forces. Thank you for the invitation from President Zelensky. My message, not only to the participants of the summit, was clear: war crimes must not go unpunished."
